# LOTINU Staking

## Project Overview
LOTINU Staking is a decentralized application (dApp) that allows users to stake their LOTINU tokens and earn rewards. With an easy-to-use interface, users can connect their wallets, view their staking statistics, and manage their stakes seamlessly on the Binance Smart Chain.

## Installation
To run the LOTINU Staking application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/lotinu-staking.git
   cd lotinu-staking
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your web browser. Ensure you have a compatible wallet (e.g., MetaMask) installed and configured to the Binance Smart Chain.

## Usage
1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. Click on the **Connect Wallet** button to connect your cryptocurrency wallet.
3. Once connected, you can view your total staked tokens, APY, unclaimed rewards, and the lock timer.
4. Enter the amount of LOTINU tokens you want to stake or manage and select the appropriate action (Approve, Claim Rewards, Withdraw).

## Features
- Connects to popular wallets (via WalletConnect) to manage your tokens.
- Displays staking statistics, such as total staked, APY, and unclaimed rewards.
- Allows users to approve tokens for staking, claim rewards, and withdraw staked tokens.
- Responsive design with a user-friendly interface styled with Tailwind CSS.

## Dependencies
The project relies on several external libraries, which are included in the `index.html` file:
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling.
- **Web3.js** for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts.
- **WalletConnect** for wallet connectivity.
- **Web3Modal** for a unified wallet connection interface.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the user interface of the LOTINU Staking application.
- `app.js`: The JavaScript file that handles blockchain interactions, wallet connectivity, and UI updates.
- Other assets (like CSS and third-party libraries) included via CDN links in the HTML file.
